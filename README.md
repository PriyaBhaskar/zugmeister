**Zugmeister Application**

This repository contains the code related to zugmeister app.
Main Focus:
  - Actual functional Implementation
  - Major build tasks with form validation
  - 100% Unit test cases coverage
  - E2E testing set up (So that automation testers can directly start focusing on the writing feature file and step definition)

## Prequisites to build stand alone FE ##

Install:
    -NodeJS + npm
    -grunt (npm install --global grunt)

## Getting started ##
1. installing all the required parts.
2. In the root of the project, where the package.json is, open the command line.
3. type:  **npm install**
    This will download and install all the required packages from grunt for development purposes. (like compass, jshint, minify, etc..)
    Also, the required libraries will be pulled into the project like Angular.
    This command will create a folder in the project root calls "node_modules"
## Build and run using grunt ##
4. type: **grunt build-feature**
   This will compile the scss, do checks , optimize, and create and concatenate all the javascripts for the app, and put in the dist folder and also start the local server.
5. open browser and type **localhost:9000/index.html**
6. run **grunt test** to only test your code

## The Traffic Meister application assignment

 - Create a form which behaves as follows
    - It will display the following drop down menus
      - A list of vehicle types, loaded when data available
      - A list of vehicle brands, loaded when data available
      - A list of vehicle brand colors, available on page load
    - All three lists are enabled when data is available.
    - When selecting an option in on of the list, the other lists are filtered accordingly.
    - At the bottom of the form all selections will be shown.
  - You are free to use any tool and/or framework you like, as long as it runs inside a browser and you can explain why that solution will be the most favorable.
  - Your implementation should be
      - tested
      - visually attractive
      - deployable

### For example.
1. When yellow is selected all types and brands that have no yellow vehicles are filtered out
2. When selecting "Bugatti Veyron", only the car type and the available colors are selectable

## Data library

The data are provided by a small service you can find in the `service` folder.

This service can be accessed by a the global variable `trafficMeister` and provide a single method `fetchData`.

```
trafficMeister.fetchData(callBack);
```

The callback is called with the full data list as first parameter.

```
trafficMeister.fetchData(function(err, data) {
  console.log(data);
});
```

The data library can be used as a node module.

```
var trafficMeister = require('traffic-meister');
trafficMeister.fetchData(function(err, data) {
  console.log(data);
});
```

## Coding Assignment Evaluation Guidelines

To give you an idea what we expect from the implementation of the assignment we came up with
the following guidelines. In general, treat it as code that will go in production for one of our clients.

### Assignment
* Does the code work.
* Does the code still work when encountering edge cases.
* Does the code come with instructions.
* Do all included artifacts have purpose.

### Code quality
* Is the code structured in a logical way.
* Could the code be extended.
* Do functions, classes and modules use the right level of abstraction.
* Does the code show software engineering best practices and design patterns where applicable.
* Is the code consistent.
* Does the code contain descriptive names.
* Is the code production ready.
* Does the code base scale to a bigger feature set.

### Frameworks + Language
* What framework was chosen.
* Are the features of the framework used according to community best practices.
* Does the code use features of the framework or language when possible.
* Are common pitfalls avoided.

### Testing
* Are there automated test.
* How are the tests written.
* What choices are made in testing certain parts of the code.
* Are the tests written with the right level of abstraction.
* What test cases are chosen.
* Does the test code make use of the features of the test framework when applicable.

### Design + CSS
* How much effort is taken into making the app look nice.
* Is user experience taken into consideration.
* How was the UI implemented.
